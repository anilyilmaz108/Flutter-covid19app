The Covid19 application allows us to access data daily or in the whole process. We can easily access data such as the number of tests, the number of patients, the number of deaths and the number of recovered patients on the desired date.

The api from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozanerturk/covid19-turkey-api/master/dataset/timeline.json detects covid cases instantly.

It is enough for covid19app to import http and font_awesome_flutter packages. Detailed documents:
